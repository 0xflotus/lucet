lucet-runtime
=============

This is an experimental release of the second version of the Lucet runtime, written in Rust. It is
currently under heavy development, in particular around the shape and nature of the public API, and
the factoring of internal modules. We strongly recommend against writing code that depends on this
crate at this time.
